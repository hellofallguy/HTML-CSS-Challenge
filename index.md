## Code challenge

We want you to build a page with a responsive menu with 6 menu items in CSS and HTML.

- For small screens, the menu should be a collapsible vertical menu with left-aligned menu item text. The page content should be below the menu. The menu and content should fill the entire width of the screen.
- For larger screens, the menu should be fully-visible horizontal menu centered on the page with centered text. The page content should show below the menu and be centered with additional margin or padding.
- When you click on the a menu item, it should show **three** dogs along with their corresponding breed.
  - Use the [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) for images and breed info (you should be able to get the breed from the file path).
  - The dog image on the left should take up 50% of the container and the breed text on the right should take up half the container and be centered vertically and horizontally. The height of the container can match the height of the image. Normalize the image dimensions for each dog if you want extra points.

### Bonus++

Populate the dog images and breed by hitting the Dog API when the page loads.
